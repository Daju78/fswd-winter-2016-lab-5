# Full Stack Web Development - Lab 6: Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?

Take a look at the `fswd-lab-6` branch of this
repository. Specfically, look at the new model (`User`) and the
migrations that have been added (in `migrations/`).

From your project directory, run `./node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate`.

Take a look at how your local database has changed.

Now we're going to build a user registration page.
